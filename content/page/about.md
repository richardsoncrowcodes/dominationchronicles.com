[**Domination Chronicles**](/) is a podcast where [Steven T. Newcomb](/host/steven-t-newcomb/) (Shawnee/Lenape) and [Peter d’Errico](/host/peter-derrico/) examine how domination shaped the legal and political foundations of the United States. They draw on decades of research into the Doctrine of Christian Discovery, federal Indian law, and the long arc of resistance by Indigenous nations. Each episode uses concrete cases, plain language, and close reading to show how old claims to a “right of domination” still shape life today.

The podcast invites listeners to think with care about history, power, and law. Newcomb and d’Errico trace how ideas from papal bulls, colonial charters, and early court rulings still inform public policy and everyday language. They pair this analysis with stories of Indigenous knowledge, community strength, and ongoing work for freedom and repair. The goal is simple: to make the systems of domination visible so we can imagine something better.
