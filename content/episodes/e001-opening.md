## Description
In this inaugural episode of *Domination Chronicles*, [Steven Newcomb](/host/steven-t-newcomb/) (Shawnee/Lenape) and [Peter d'Errico](/peter-derrico/) deepen a decades-long dialogue on how systems of domination have shaped U.S. federal Indian law, beginning with the 1823 Johnson v. *McIntosh* decision and its roots in 15th-century "Christian Discovery" doctrines. Their conversation weaves together the story behind *Oyate Woyaka*---a new PBS film on Lakota language history and revitalization---and a broader critique of how race, gender, language, and worldview mask or perpetuate domination across human societies and the natural world.
