## Introduction


# DOMINATION CHRONICLES SHOW NOTES
January 10,2026

## THE FEDERAL INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL REPORT:
*LANGUAGE, CONTEXT,AND SIGNIFICANCE*

Today we focus on what was billed as an “historic apology” by the US government for atrocities committed by the so-called “Indian boarding schools”—prisons for children taken from their homes and subjected to what the Report calls “systematic militarized and identity-alteration methodologies” to break their ties with their Peoples—all as part of what the Report calls “a twin policy: Indian territorial dispossession and Indian assimilation”.

We focus on “assimilation” and “dispossession” within the Domination framework attacking Original Free Existence.

Our conversation includes the ways in which laws and policies of Domination continue today in various guises and disguises.
