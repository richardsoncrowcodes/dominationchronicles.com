## Description

In this episode, [Steve Newcomb](host/steven-t-newcomb) and [Peter d'Errico](/host/peter-d-erico/)dissect a recent concurring opinion from the Washington State Supreme Court that denounces the racist language in foundational federal Indian law cases while leaving the core doctrines of domination untouched. Using the [FLYING T RANCH v. STILLAGUAMISH TRIBE](https://turtletalk.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/103430-0-opinion.pdf) decision as their entry point, they expose a crucial distinction: cleaning up offensive rhetoric does nothing to dismantle the legal architecture that continues to deny Indigenous sovereignty and legitimize settler control over Native lands. Steve and Peter demonstrate how well-meaning critiques of racist language can actually obscure the persistence of domination by allowing courts to appear enlightened while perpetuating the same colonial doctrines—now dressed in sanitized prose. The conversation challenges listeners to see through the emperor's new clothes: redacting slurs doesn't erase the extravagant pretension that Euro-American law has legitimate authority over peoples who never surrendered their freedom and independence.

This gives us an opportunity to show the limitations of critiquing the rhetoric of legal decisions, instead of challenging the actual doctrines established by those decisions.
We show that the rhetoric of domination is not the same as the domination decisions themselves: Redacting the rhetoric leaves the domination intact.
