## Introduction
In this Domination Chronicles podcast, hosts Peter d'Errico and Steven Newcomb draw on their 90 years of combined experience to analyze how linguistic definitions reveal a "pattern of domination" used against Indigenous nations. The episode focuses on seven key terms used to justify the loss of Indigenous freedom and the rise of the United States as an empire.


## Key Terminology and Definitions

The hosts break down the "underlying code" of colonization through these specific lenses:

-   **Civilization:** Defined as the "forcing of a cultural pattern" onto a population where that pattern is foreign.

-   **State:** Referencing Max Weber, they define the state as a "relation of men dominating men" where the dominated must submit to authority.

-   **Sovereignty:** Characterized by Jonathan Havercroft as an "unjust form of political domination" that restricts human freedom.

-   **Ascendancy:** Linked to the 1823 *Johnson v. McIntosh* ruling, where it was used as a rationale for European "controlling influence" over native inhabitants.

-   **Dominion:** Traced to the Latin *dominium*, signifying political power that grows from property and results in domination.

-   **Property:** Described by jurist William Blackstone as "despotic dominion" or the first socially approved "physical domination" over the natural world.

-   **Empire:** Identified by George Washington as the goal for the United States, representing a "sovereignty that would expand" in power and territory.
