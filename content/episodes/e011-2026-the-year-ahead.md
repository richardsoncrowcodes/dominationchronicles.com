## Introduction

DOMINATION CHRONICLES: 2026 -- THE YEAR AHEAD
============================================

Our New Year's Day conversation presents a variety of topics we intend to discuss in the months ahead in a continuing exploration of Free Existence and Domination. We will invite guests to join us in some of these episodes.

The focus throughout---as always in Domination Chronicles---is on words and meanings, connecting dots in overlapping and entangled histories, opening ways to step outside conventional approaches, penetrating institutional and narrative façades, always in an effort to understand Life.

We emphasize the necessity of deep, wide, and close reading of all documents---legal and other---with an aim to articulate manifestations of "free existence" and "domination".

Our topics will include some of the most recent technologies---like so-called "artificial intelligence"---and some of the longest-running narratives---like "sympathy" and "apology" for dominations.

Selected legal cases and professional publications will also come under our scrutiny.
